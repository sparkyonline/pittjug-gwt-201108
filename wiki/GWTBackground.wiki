#summary Some background info on GWT.

= Introduction =

What is [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit GWT], and why did I care?

= Details =

GWT is a web toolkit/framework, provided by Google, for Java developers to create complex web application within a language that is already familiar.  Many browser inconsistencies are abstracted away, and the developer can develop in a more traditional code/debug cycle.  There are also many bells and whistles to keep even a seasoned developer interested.

Having been primarily focused on middleware, I was suddenly tasked with looking at frontend development.  While working on a struts / jQuery project, I was also intrigued by things I heard about GWT.  Namely:

  * Little to no HTML/!JavaScript coding required
  * Strongly typed, compile time checking
  * Asynchronous communication written in Java
  * Good Eclipse debugging support

So, I set off to see what I could get going in GWT, both from a command-line perspective, and utilizing the Eclipse support provided by Google.
