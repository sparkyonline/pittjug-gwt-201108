#summary Beginning with GWT Designer

= Introduction =

The Google Eclipse plugin ships with a lite version of Windowbuilder's GWT designer, but you can still install the full version separately.


= Details =

Since we installed the full-blown version of the GWT Designer (WindowBuilder), we can use it to inspect and edit our GWT modules.

  * Navigate to the client Entry Point class in Project/Package Explorer.
  * Right-click the class, and select Open With > WindowBuilder Editor.
  * This is a standard Java class editor, with an additional tab at the bottom to switch to "Design" view:
